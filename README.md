## 📖 About This Repository

Welcome to **Career Launchpad**. This repository serves as a comprehensive log of my weekly progression into **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning**. 

My goal is not just to write code, but to understand the **internal mechanics** of how systems work, apply them to **real-life scenarios**, and build practical solutions. Each folder represents a week of structured learning, ranging from statistical foundations to advanced neural networks.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

I focus on industry-standard tools to build robust systems:

* **Languages:** 🐍 Python, SQL
* **Data Manipulation:** 📊 Pandas, NumPy
* **Machine Learning:** 🤖 Scikit-Learn
* **Deep Learning:** 🧠 TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
* **Visualization:** 📈 Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Environment:** 📓 Jupyter Notebooks, Anaconda
